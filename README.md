# Penney's Game Project

## Description
This project simulates Penney’s Game playing and scoring with both cards and tricks to determine the optimal starting sequences. When scoring the game with cards, there is a strategic advantage based on how sequences are chosen, despite the appearance of fairness. First, let your opponent choose their sequence and then you choose a sequence that is statistically more likely to appear before your opponent's sequence. For example, if the pattern of your opponent’s sequence is 123, your sequence should be ~212 to increase your chances of a win. This strategy for winning Penney’s game prompted the main research questions explored in this analysis, which include:
How does Penney’s game’s winner probability differ when we score based on trick counts rather than card counts? Why?
Does the winner probability change when ties are accounted for in each play?
